\usage{
install_themes(
  apply_theme = c("rscodeio", "Tomorrow Night Bright (rscodeio)"),
  style_menu_bar = TRUE,
  install_globally = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{apply_theme}{The rscodeio editor theme variant to apply. All variants are installed and the one specified here is activated right away. The other
variants can be selected anytime later in RStudio's global options. Variation only affects the syntax highlighting and terminal styling. One of
\itemize{
\item \code{"rscodeio"} for the default color variant inspired by Visual Studio Code.
\item \code{"Tomorrow Night Bright (rscodeio)"} for the colors known from the similarly named default RStudio theme.
}}

\item{style_menu_bar}{Whether to also install rscodeio's custom QSS files to style RStudio's menu bar. Administrator privileges are required.}

\item{install_globally}{Whether to install the editor themes for the current user (\code{FALSE}) or all users globally (\code{TRUE}). The latter may require
administrator privileges.}
}
\value{
Nothing (\code{NULL} invisibly).
}
\description{
RStudio 1.2 or later is required for this. Additionally, administrator privileges are required to also install the Qt Style Sheet (QSS) files to style
RStudio's menu bar, something which is not possible with \href{https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio-theme-creation.html}{RStudio's current theming API}.
}
\section{Menu bar styling}{
On Linux, it will be asked interactively for administrator credentials by calling \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polkit}{Polkit}'s
\href{https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/pkexec.1.html}{\code{pkexec}}. Windows users must run RStudio as administrator in order to install
rscodeio's menu bar styling. On macOS and RStudio Server, menu bar styling is not necessary and thus always skipped.

The installation of the QSS files styling the menu bar can be skipped by setting \code{style_menu_bar = FALSE}. See \code{\link[=install_menu_theme]{install_menu_theme()}} for more details about
the menu bar styling.
