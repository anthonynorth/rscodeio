Description: This package provides two greyish dark RStudio
    editor themes which only differ in the syntax highlighting style:
    while 'rscodeio' offers the colors found in Visual Studio Code,
    'Tomorrow Night Bright (rscodeio)' combines this package's dark
    interface theming with the syntax highlighting colors from the
    similarly named editor theme provided by RStudio. Furthermore, both
    themes style RStudio's menu, something which is not exposed by the
    current theming API and therefore requires administrator privileges to
    replace the relevant QSS files.
