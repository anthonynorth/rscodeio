# rscodeio

An RStudio theme inspired by Visual Studio Code

## Prerequisites

-   RStudio 1.2.0 or later

-   Administrator privileges (more on that [below](#details))

## Installation

Run the following to install the package:

``` {.r}
if (!("remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {
  install.packages(pkgs = "remotes",
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
}

remotes::install_github("anthonynorth/rscodeio")
```

Then run the following to install the rscodeio editor themes and menu bar styling:

``` {.r}
rscodeio::install_themes()
```

The above command right away activates the editor theme variant specified in the `apply_theme` argument (which defaults to `"rscodeio"`). To activate the second
editor theme variant instead, run:

``` {.r}
rscodeio::install_themes(apply_theme = "Tomorrow Night Bright (rscodeio)")
```

The chosen editor theme can be changed anytime later in RStudio's global options.

To completely uninstall the rscodeio editor themes and menu bar styling again, run:

``` {.r}
rscodeio::uninstall_themes()
```

## Details {#details}

This package provides two greyish dark RStudio editor themes which only differ in the syntax highlighting style: while `rscodeio` offers the colors found in
Visual Studio Code, `Tomorrow Night Bright (rscodeio)` combines the same dark interface theming with the syntax highlighting colors from the similarly named
editor theme provided by RStudio.

Furthermore, RStudio's menu bar will be changed to a matching dark style, something which is not exposed by [RStudio's current theming
API](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio-theme-creation.html) and therefore requires administrator privileges to replace the relevant [Qt Style
Sheet (QSS)](https://doc.qt.io/Qt-5/stylesheet-syntax.html) files in RStudio's installation directory.

-   On Linux, it will be asked interactively for administrator credentials by calling [Polkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polkit)'s
    [`pkexec`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/pkexec.1.html).

-   On Windows, RStudio must be run as administrator for rscodeio being able to successfully install the menu bar styling.

-   On macOS and RStudio Server, menu bar styling is not necessary and thus administrator privileges are not required. (On macOS, the light/dark menu bar
    styling is inherited from the OS, so you might want to use your dark OS theme.)

### Recommended RStudio settings

For best results, make sure the following settings are enabled:

-   <kbd>Tools</kbd> → <kbd>Global Options...</kbd> → <kbd>Code</kbd> → <kbd>Display</kbd> → **☑ Highlight selected line**
-   <kbd>Tools</kbd> → <kbd>Global Options...</kbd> → <kbd>Code</kbd> → <kbd>Display</kbd> → **☑ Show indent guides**
-   <kbd>Tools</kbd> → <kbd>Global Options...</kbd> → <kbd>Code</kbd> → <kbd>Display</kbd> → **☑ Show syntax highlighting in console input**
-   <kbd>Tools</kbd> → <kbd>Global Options...</kbd> → <kbd>Code</kbd> → <kbd>Display</kbd> → **☑ Highlight R function calls**

### Switching to another theme

As mentioned above, rscodeio provides custom editor theme variants but also styles RStudio's menu bar by replacing some QSS files. This means the RStudio menu
bar will remain dark even if you switch to another editor theme. To revert the menu bar to its default state, **administrator privileges are required**.

To only remove the menu bar styling, run

``` {.r}
rscodeio::uninstall_menu_theme()
```

To reinstall the menu bar styling again, run

``` {.r}
rscodeio::install_menu_theme()
```

On Windows, for both of the above to work, Rstudio must be run as administrator.

**Note** that the menu bar styling has to be reinstalled after *every* update or reinstallation of RStudio. This is because the custom QSS files provided by
rscodeio get overwritten during RStudio's installation process.

### Supported Platforms

`rscodeio` has only been tested on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu and Pop!\_OS Linux) so far. [Feedback](https://github.com/anthonynorth/rscodeio/issues) from other
platforms is welcome.
